Overview of the Project
Project: simple calculator using python programming
The Simple Python Calculator is a command-line application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator allows users to repeatedly perform calculations until they choose to exit the application. The program is implemented in Python, leveraging fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditional statements to create an interactive and user-friendly tool.

Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to allow continuous use until the user decides to exit.

Key Activities
Implement Arithmetic Functions
User Interface (Command-Line)
Input Validation
Error Handling

Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used to develop the calculator.
Built-in Functions:
input(): Used for taking user inputs.
print(): Used for displaying outputs and prompts to the user.
Control Structures:
if-elif-else: Used for decision-making based on user input.
while True:: Used for creating a loop that allows the user to continue using the calculator until they choose to exit.
